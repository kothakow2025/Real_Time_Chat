# Unfriend Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the unfriend functionality that allows users to unfriend someone and permanently delete all conversations and media files from the database.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Unfriend View (`accounts/views.py`)
- **Location**: `accounts/views.py` - `unfriend_user` function
- **Functionality**:
  - Validates that users are actually friends before unfriending
  - Permanently deletes all conversations between the two users
  - Deletes all media files (images and videos) associated with messages
  - Removes the friend request record
  - Provides comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### 2. User Interface Updates

#### User List Page (`templates/accounts/user_list.html`)
- Added unfriend button for existing friends
- Confirmation dialog before unfriending
- AJAX handling for smooth user experience
- Automatic UI updates after unfriending

#### User Profile Page (`templates/accounts/user_profile.html`)
- Added unfriend button for friends
- Confirmation dialog with clear warning about data deletion
- AJAX handling for seamless interaction

#### Friend Requests Page (`templates/accounts/friend_requests.html`)
- Added new "Friends" tab to show all accepted friends
- Unfriend functionality for each friend
- Cancel friend request functionality for sent requests
- Enhanced navigation with friend count badges

### 3. Backend Improvements

#### Media File Deletion
- Properly deletes image files from `chat_media/images/` directory
- Properly deletes video files from `chat_media/videos/` directory
- Handles file system errors gracefully
- Uses Django's file field path resolution

#### Database Cleanup
- Deletes all messages in conversations between users
- Removes MessageReadStatus records (cascade delete)
- Deletes conversation records
- Removes friend request records

### 4. Security Features
- Validates user authentication before unfriending
- Ensures users can only unfriend their actual friends
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Input validation for user IDs

### 5. User Experience
- Confirmation dialogs to prevent accidental unfriending
- Clear messaging about permanent data deletion
- Loading states during AJAX requests
- Success/error notifications
- Automatic UI updates without page refresh

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Structure Changes
```
accounts/
├── views.py (enhanced unfriend_user function)
├── management/
│   └── commands/
│       └── test_unfriend.py (test command)
templates/accounts/
├── user_list.html (added unfriend UI)
├── user_profile.html (added unfriend UI)
└── friend_requests.html (added friends tab and unfriend UI)
```

### Key Functions

#### `unfriend_user(request)` in `accounts/views.py`
```python
@login_required
@require_POST
def unfriend_user(request):
    # Validates friendship status
    # Deletes media files
    # Removes database records
    # Returns JSON response
```

### Database Operations
1. **Friend Request Deletion**: Removes the accepted friend request
2. **Message Deletion**: Deletes all messages in shared conversations
3. **Media File Deletion**: Removes physical files from storage
4. **Conversation Deletion**: Removes conversation records
5. **Cascade Cleanup**: MessageReadStatus records are automatically deleted

### Error Handling
- Invalid user ID validation
- Friendship status verification
- File system error handling
- Database transaction safety
- Comprehensive error messages

## Usage

### For Users
1. Navigate to a friend's profile or the friends list
2. Click the "Unfriend" button
3. Confirm the action in the dialog
4. All data will be permanently deleted

### For Developers
- The unfriend functionality is available via POST request to `/accounts/unfriend/`
- Requires authentication and valid user_id parameter
- Returns JSON response with success/error status

## Testing
A management command `test_unfriend` has been created to verify the functionality:
```bash
python manage.py test_unfriend
```

## Security Considerations
- All unfriend operations require user authentication
- Users can only unfriend their actual friends
- CSRF protection is enabled on all forms
- Input validation prevents malicious requests
- File deletion is handled safely with error catching

## Future Enhancements
- Add audit logging for unfriend actions
- Implement soft delete option for conversations
- Add bulk unfriend functionality
- Create admin interface for managing friendships
